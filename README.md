## CSS Grid layout practice 

This repo practice is following Udemy Advanced CSS & Sass course. 

### Note from my coding bible 
1. Explicit Grid: defined grid 
   Implicit Grid: not defined but created automatically

2. grid-auto-row, grid-auto-column are for implicit Grid

3. Named grid is much easier

4. align-self and justify-self are ignored when use span for grid        (don't know why but I found out during practice)

5. minmax(#minsize,#maxsize) -> good for template value

6. auto-fit is really good for layout withough media query(save time!) :lollipop:

#### Confusing 

1. justify-content and justify-items

2. align-items and align-content

Still need to change at all the time to make a centre! :cookie:
